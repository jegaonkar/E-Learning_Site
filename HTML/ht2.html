                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A Brief Overview
                    
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It is the backbone of the World Wide Web and is essential for displaying content on the internet. HTML documents are composed of elements, which are represented by tags and are used to define the structure and content of a web page. <br>
                    <br>
                    Key Points:</p>

<span class="sub_point">1. Basic Structure:</span> <br>
<p>HTML documents have a hierarchical structure consisting of elements enclosed in opening and closing tags. The primary elements include < html >, < head >, and < body >.
</p>
<span class="sub_point">2. Hyperlinks: </span> <br>
<p>HTML allows for the creation of hyperlinks (links) between web pages, enabling users to navigate the internet by clicking on text or images.</p>
<span class="sub_point">3. Text and Media:</span> <br>
<p>HTML facilitates the incorporation of text, images, audio, and video content into web pages.</p>
<span class="sub_point">4. HTML Versions:</span> <br>
<p><br>HTML 1.0 (1993): The first version of HTML, with basic structure and links. <br>
    HTML 2.0 (1995): Introduced forms for user input. <br>
    HTML 3.2 (1997): Improved support for tables and frames. <br>
    HTML 4.0 (1997-1999): Brought style and formatting features. <br>
    XHTML (2000): A stricter, XML-based version of HTML. <br>
    HTML5 (2014): The latest and most widely used version, introducing many new elements and features, including video and audio support, canvas for graphics, and more.</p>
<span class="sub_point">5. History of HTML:</span> <br>
<p><br>1989-1990: HTML's origin can be traced back to Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, who developed the first web browser and web server while working at CERN. The first HTML specification was created for these early web applications. <br> <br>
    1993: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded, playing a crucial role in standardizing HTML. HTML 1.0 was introduced as the first official specification. <br> <br>
    Mid-1990s: HTML 2.0 added support for forms and interactive elements, making web pages more dynamic. <br> <br>
    Late 1990s: HTML 3.2 improved support for tables and frames, enhancing web page layout. <br> <br>
    Late 1990s: HTML 4.0 introduced stylesheets, scripting, and improved support for multimedia content. <br> <br>
    Early 2000s: XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) aimed to reformulate HTML as an XML application, enforcing stricter coding standards. <br> <br>
    2014: HTML5, the most recent major version, was released. It brought numerous new elements and features, such as audio and video elements, the < canvas > for graphics, and support for more sophisticated web applications. <br>
       <p> HTML continues to evolve, with the latest version being HTML5. It forms the core technology for creating web pages and is supported by all modern web browsers. HTML is often used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web experiences.</p>
