                <p>In this lesson, we will explore the fundamentals of adding text to a web page using HTML. Text is a fundamental component of web content, and understanding how to structure and format it is essential for effective web development.</p>
				

<span class="sub_point">1. Adding Text to Your Page:</span> <br>
<p> <li><b>Creating Text Elements:</b> HTML offers several tags to create text elements. These include: <br>                                                                                    </li>
    <li><b>Headings (< h1> to < h6>): </b> Used for defining headings or subheadings. < h1> is the highest level, typically representing the main title, and < h6> is the lowest. <br> <br> </li>
    <li><b>Paragraphs (< p>): </b>Used for structuring and formatting paragraphs of text. <br><br> </li>
    <li><b>Inline Text Elements: </b>Tags like < span>, < strong>, < em>, and others allow you to style specific portions of text within paragraphs or headings. <br> <br> </li>
    <li><b> Text Formatting: </b> HTML provides basic text formatting options through tags.For example: <br> <br> </li>

    <li><b>Font Size (< font size="">): </b>You can change the size of text using this attribute. However, using CSS is the recommended way for text styling. <br> <br>           </li>
    <li><b>Font Color (< font color="">): </b>This attribute lets you change the color of text. Again, CSS is the preferred method. <br> <br> </li>
    <li><b>Text Alignment (< p align="">):</b> You can use this attribute to control the alignment of text within a paragraph. CSS is a better choice for alignment. <br> <br> </li>

    <li><b>Semantic Elements: </b> HTML5 introduced semantic elements like < header>, < footer>, < article>, and < section, which provide meaning to the structure of a web page. Using these elements helps with accessibility and SEO. For instance, < header> is used to define the header section of a webpage, and < footer> defines the footer section. <br> <br> </li>
</p>
<span class="sub_point">2. Headings and Paragraphs: </span> <br>
<p>This lesson focuses on two fundamental text elements in HTML: headings and paragraphs. <br>
    <b>Headings: </b>HTML provides six levels of headings (< h1> to < h6). These are used to structure content hierarchically. < h1> is the highest level, typically representing the main title or heading of a webpage, while < h6> is the lowest and usually used for subheadings. <br><br>

    <b>Paragraphs: </b> The < p> tag is used to create paragraphs. It's essential for structuring text content, making it more readable and organized. You can apply CSS styles to paragraphs to control their appearance, such as line spacing and margins. <br><br>

    <b>Structuring Content: </b>Effective web content often combines headings and paragraphs to create a well-structured page. Headings provide a clear hierarchy, and paragraphs are used for in-depth content. Proper use of headings and paragraphs improves readability and accessibility. <br><br>

</p>


<span class="sub_point">3. Text Formatting: Bold, Italic, Underline, and More</span> <br>
<p> <br> 
 
 <b>Bold and Italic Text (< strong> and < em>): </b> You can use the < strong> tag to make text bold for emphasis and the < em> tag to italicize text for additional emphasis. These tags also carry semantic meaning, with < strong> indicating strong importance and < em> indicating emphasis.<br> <br>
  <b> Underlining Text (< u>):  </b>The < u> tag is used to underline text. However, underlining is less common in modern web design because it can be confused with hyperlinks. <br> <br>

 <b> Strikethrough Text (< s>): </b>The < s> tag adds a strikethrough line to text. It's often used to indicate that text has been deleted or is no longer relevant. <br> <br>

<b> Inline Styling (<span>): </b>The < span> tag is a generic container that allows you to apply inline styles to specific portions of text. This is often used in conjunction with CSS for more precise text styling. <br> <br>

    <b>Typography:</b> This topic covers more advanced text formatting options, such as controlling text alignment (left, center, right), line height (line spacing), and letter spacing (spacing between characters). These aspects contribute to the overall typography of your web page. <br> <br>


    
</p>
<span class="sub_point">4. Lists (Ordered and Unordered):</span> <br>
<p><br>This lesson introduces you to the concept of lists in HTML, which are crucial for organizing and presenting information effectively.<br> <br>
   
    <b>Ordered Lists (< ol>): </b> An ordered list is a numbered list. You use the < ol> element to create one and add individual list items with the < li> tag. Ordered lists are often used for instructions or lists with a specific sequence. <br><br>

        <b>Unordered Lists (< ul>):</b> An unordered list is a bullet-point list. You use the < ul> element to create one and also add list items with the < li> tag. Unordered lists are suitable for items that don't require a specific order. <br><br>

        <b>List Customization:</b> You can use CSS to customize the appearance of lists. This includes changing bullet styles, adding background colors, and controlling the spacing between list items. Customized lists can enhance the visual appeal of your web pages.
